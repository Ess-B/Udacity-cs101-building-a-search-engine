# A leap year baby is a baby born on Feb 29, which occurs only on a leap year.

# Define a procedure is_leap_baby that takes 3 inputs: day, month and year
# and returns True if the date is a leap day (Feb 29 in a valid leap year)
# and False otherwise.

# A year that is a multiple of 4 is a leap year unless the year is
# divisible by 100 but not a multiple of 400 (so, 1900 is not a leap
# year but 2000 and 2004 are).

def is_leap_baby(day,month,year):
    # Write your code after this line.
    if day == 29:
        if month == 2:
            if year % 4 != 0:
                return False
            elif year % 100 != 0:
                return True
            elif year % 400 != 0:
                return False
            else:
                return True
    else:
        return False
